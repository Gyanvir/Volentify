  { title: 'Report only what you see.', body: 'Making or circulating a false alarm about a disaster, its severity or its magnitude is an offence under Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 — up to one year in prison or a fine. Command can reject false reports and quarantine the phone that sent them.' },
  { title: 'One report per situation.', body: 'Sending the same SOS again does not make it faster — every copy competes for the same Bluetooth airtime. The app refuses a repeat of the same report type within a minute, and caps reports at 10 an hour per phone.' },
  { title: 'Unverified until reviewed.', body: 'Field reports and messages are unverified until an incident controller reviews them. Only messages marked “Official · Volentify command” come from verified command; “Automated” advisories are guidance generated from GDACS, USGS and NASA data. Never forward rumours.' },
  { title: 'Keep identities out of reports.', body: 'Do not type Aadhaar, PAN, ration-card, bank or phone numbers, caste, religion or other people’s full names. Reports pass through strangers’ phones. Volentify removes identity and phone numbers automatically, on the phone and again on the server.' },
  { title: 'Don’t put yourself at risk to file a report.', body: 'Never enter flood water, damaged buildings, fire or gas-leak areas to take a photo or a GPS fix. A report from a safe place a few hundred metres away is just as useful.' },

    rules: ['File one report, then leave the relay switched on — it keeps passing other people’s reports', 'Use “Mask my location” if being found by strangers is a risk; switch it off if you need rescuers to find you', 'Follow only warnings from IMD, CWC, INCOIS, your SDMA or messages marked Official'],
  },

    role: 'Volunteers', who: 'Neighbours and trained responders on foot or two-wheelers, clearing debris, ferrying water, checking on people.',
    risks: ['Entering live flood currents, collapsed structures or gas leaks without training', 'Two volunteers racing to the same mission', 'Accepting a mission and then going unreachable', 'Mis-grading a report (an insulin need marked “low”)'],
    rules: ['Specialist missions (boat rescue, paramedic, drone) are only offered to people holding that skill', 'Hold at most three active missions; start an accepted mission within 45 minutes or it returns to the board', 'Confirm the safety pledge when you start a mission; turn back from water and tell command', 'Close missions honestly — “people helped” feeds your profile and the public figures'],
  },

    role: 'NGOs & relief agencies', who: 'Teams running camps, kitchens, supply trucks and health camps.',
    risks: ['Two organisations supplying Camp A while Camp B gets nothing', 'Fulfilling fabricated resource requests', 'Storing beneficiaries’ identities on shared phones'],
    rules: ['NGO accounts are verified by an administrator before they can create missions or see casualty details', 'Treat resource requests as unverified until reviewed; a false claim for relief is an offence (DM Act 2005, s.52)', 'Mesh reports carry counts and needs, never beneficiary identities'],
  },
  {
    role: 'Incident command (NDRF, SDRF, DEOC)', who: 'Commanders coordinating boats, helicopters and specialist teams from an emergency operations centre.',
    risks: ['An erroneous public alert causing panic', 'Drowning in trivial requests while people are trapped', 'Broadcasting the positions of scarce assets on an open channel'],

const APP_RULES = [
  ['Duplicate guard', 'A repeat of the same report type within 60 seconds is refused; at most 10 reports and 30 messages an hour per phone.'],
  ['Privacy filter', 'Aadhaar, PAN, card or account and phone numbers are replaced with [removed] before a report is saved, and again on the server.'],
  ['Priority sanity', 'Critical is reserved for people trapped or missing, medical emergencies, fire and flooding; everything else is capped at High.'],
  ['Hop budget', 'Every report travels at most five phone-to-phone hops and is capped at 4 KB, so the mesh cannot be flooded. Duplicates are dropped by event ID.'],
  ['Official means official', '“Official · Volentify command” appears only on messages a phone downloaded from the Volentify server. A message relayed over Bluetooth that claims to be official is shown as an unverified relay.'],
  ['Location masking', 'An optional ±500 m shift before coordinates leave the phone.'],
  ['Battery saver', 'Below 15 % battery and not charging, the app scans and relays less often.'],
  ['Short memory', 'Reports are deleted from the phone 72 hours after the server confirms them.'],
];

const SECURITY = [
  ['Who you are', 'Passwords are hashed with scrypt; sessions are signed, HTTP-only cookies that expire after 72 hours. Google sign-in tokens are verified against Google’s keys, audience, issuer and a one-time nonce.'],
  ['What you may do', 'Every action is checked on the server against your role. Command and NGO roles need verification by an administrator; changing your role through onboarding never carries a verification over.'],
  ['Staff accounts', 'The volentify.com address space is reserved: nobody can register with it. Four regulator accounts hold regulation and monitoring access, and only a regulator can change another regulator.'],
  ['Phones', 'Gateway uploads use short-lived tokens; no server secret ships in the app. Uploads without a token are accepted as public reports and rate-limited per network (20 a minute; 60 with a token). Phone IDs are random, never hardware addresses, and Bluetooth scanning is declared “never for location”.'],
  ['Spoofing', 'Fields such as “official” and the sender’s role are set only by the server. A phone or a web form cannot make a message look like it came from command.'],
  ['False reports', 'Command can reject a report (it disappears from public views) and quarantine the phone that sent it; its later uploads are dropped.'],
  ['Accountability', 'Sign-ins to command accounts, role changes, alerts, mission and review decisions and quarantines are written to a hash-chained audit log, kept for at least 180 days. Administrators can verify the chain at any time.'],
  ['What is not protected', 'Mesh messages are not end-to-end encrypted: any phone that relays a report can read it. That is why reports carry counts and needs rather than identities, and why people-related reports are summarised for everyone except verified command.'],
];

  { name: 'Disaster Management Act, 2005', points: ['Section 54: a false alarm or warning about a disaster that causes panic is punishable with up to one year’s imprisonment or a fine.', 'Section 52: a knowingly false claim for relief is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and a fine.', 'Volentify therefore never labels citizen or volunteer messages as warnings, and labels its automated advisories “not an official warning”.'] },
  { name: 'Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023', points: ['Personal data may be processed without consent to respond to a medical emergency or to help people during a disaster (Section 7, legitimate uses) — so a distress report never waits for a consent screen.', 'Data minimisation: free text and exact coordinates of field reports are minimised 30 days after the observation once the incident is closed. No personal data is sold or used for advertising.'] },
  { name: 'CERT-In Directions, 28 April 2022', points: ['Logs of privileged actions are kept for at least 180 days (the audit trail).', 'Cyber incidents affecting the platform are to be reported to CERT-In within six hours of being noticed.'] },
